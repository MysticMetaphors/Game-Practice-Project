"This folder serves as the central repository for all game entities. 
It includes key elements such as the player character, enemy units, 
allied characters, and pets. These entities are essential components 
of the game, each playing a unique role in gameplay mechanics and interactions. 
Organizing them in a dedicated folder ensures easy access 
and streamlined management during development.
